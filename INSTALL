INSTALLATION

If you already have setuptools installed, installation is a simple
two-step process:

  1. Run setup.py (as root) for statusnet.py:
     $ cd statusnet
     $ sudo python setup.py install

  2. Run setup.py (as root) for identicurse proper:
     $ cd ..
     $ sudo python setup.py install

And you're done! Read the README to get up to speed on configuring
IdentiCurse to your liking, or (this is recommended for most users)
just run "identicurse" straight away to get going with an automatically-
generated config.


If you do not have setuptools installed, you will need to either
install your distribution's package for it, or manually install it if
your distribution does not provide a package (instructions for which
will not be given here).  The package name for setuptools in various
distributions is known to be:

        python-setuptools   in  Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE
        python2-distribute  in  Arch
        pysetuptools        in  Slackware
        devel/py-setuptools in  OpenBSD, FreeBSD

        (if your distribution of choice is not in this list yet,
        feel free to inform us of the correct package name)

Once you have setuptools installed, you can proceed with the install
as above.
